# MIDIO ‚Äì Safety Object Detection (Space Station Challenge)

This project was developed for Duality AI‚Äôs HackAura Hackathon, specifically the Space Station Safety Object Detection Challenge #2. The goal is to train and evaluate a deep learning model that can detect multiple safety-related objects in space station environments.

## üöÄ What it Does

- Identifies and localizes safety-critical objects (e.g., helmets, fire extinguishers, tools) in images from simulated space station environments.  
- Uses **YOLOv8**, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, for high-accuracy, real-time detection.  
- Integrates with the **Duality AI Falcon platform** to process virtual camera feeds and provide automated safety monitoring.  
- **Landing page built on Framer** to showcase the project and provide user access.  
- **Model backend hosted on Vercel** for real-time inference.  
- **Gradio API** used as the bridge between frontend and backend.  
- Generates performance metrics and visual results to assess detection effectiveness.

## üîÑ How it Works

1. **Data Preparation:** Images from simulated space station scenes are annotated with bounding boxes for each safety object.  
2. **Model Training:** YOLOv8 is trained on the labeled dataset to recognize and locate multiple classes of safety equipment.  
3. **Model Hosting:** The trained model is deployed on **Vercel**, exposed via a Gradio API for inference.  
4. **Falcon Integration:** The detection model can connect to the Falcon platform, enabling real-time inference on virtual space station camera feeds.  
5. **Landing Page:** A **Framer-built landing page** acts as the project‚Äôs front door, directing users to the Vercel-powered model interface.  
6. **Evaluation:** Model performance is measured using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and mAP.
